Developed a fully responsive and dynamic task management application using React.js, designed to allow users to create, update, and manage daily tasks efficiently. The project demonstrates deep understanding and practical application of core React concepts, including:

React Hooks: Used useState, useEffect, and useRef to manage component state, lifecycle behaviors, and DOM references.

Props & Component Reusability: Designed reusable components like TaskCard, Modal, and Button, using props to dynamically pass and render data.

Custom Hooks: Built multiple custom hooks (useFetch, useForm) to abstract logic like API data fetching and form handling, improving code modularity and reusability.

Custom API Integration: Connected with a custom Node.js/Express backend via Axios to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

UI/UX Features: Implemented clean UI with component-based layout and smooth user experience using CSS Modules and conditional rendering.

Error Handling & Optimization: Integrated proper error handling for API calls and implemented loading states and debounced search for better performance.
